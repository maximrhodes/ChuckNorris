# Chuck Norris App

> The App was made in the context of the **[TeachingAndroid](https://github.com/NicolasDuponchel/TeachingAndroid)** Course OUAP-4316. 

The goal of the app is to be able to display Chuck Norris jokes taken from the **[Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/)**.
It should have the ability to :
- **save** jokes as favorites
- **share** jokes to your friends 
- keep the same jokes regardless of how the phone is **oriented**
## Creation of the App

I have followed the different steps in order to create the app :

**1. create a dynamic list and a layout**
 > I used the help of a custom View (**[RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView)** and an adapter
